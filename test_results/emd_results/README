This directory contains the results of running EMD on both the synthetic and ECRDB62A data. 

EMD outputs results like this:

motif number
site-sequence, sequence ID, start position in sequence, length

These results were created using the data and shell script in the directory test_data/

They were run using a default width of 15 and 5 motifs.
