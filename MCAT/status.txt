Tasks:
Scoring:
	Get working pvalue generator
	Integrate into pipeline
    qfast implemented, seems to be working?
Combining:
	Any new ideas?
	Integrate into pipeline
    Done! (unless anyone has a better idea)
Testing:
	Generate datasets
	Find best/worst performance of MCAT with synth data
	Find best/worst performance of other pipelines (EMD, any others?)
Visualization:
    Ensure correct scores are being displayed
    Make # of results visualized a command line parameter
    Done!
Other:
	weeder needs freq files generated from genome
		is this user's responsibility, or can any of it be automated?
        User's responsibility, make sure we mention that.
Writing:
	Scoring - Jake/Zhen/Yanshen
	Combining - Jeff (unless we use someone else's better idea)
	Testing:
		seq_gen - Jake
		YEASTRACT - Jeff
		other pipelines - Christy/Yanshen
		Synth or other test results - everyone
    Discussion - everyone (model after other ensemble papers?)
	Reviewing/editing - everyone

Timeline:
March 20
Zhen (and Yanshen?): Report on MAST/pval usage
Christy: Report on other pipelines
Jake: Report on current p-value calculations, anything new with synth data generator?
Jeff: Report on combineMotifs results and automated synth data runner and tester

March 27
Christy: Bioinformatics journal chosen (anything else about this?), results from testing with EMD
Jake: Changes to pval
Jeff: integration of combine method, writing
Yanshen: Testing, writing
Zhen: MAST/qfast integration

April 3
Jeff: bug fixes, added # of motifs to vis as command line param, added check for sequences with dup names
Jake/Zhen: Finished? implementing and integrating qfast in pipeline
Yanshen: Testing (working with old tools)
