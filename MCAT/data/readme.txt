These folders contain fasta files from several different sources.
Most folder names follow this format "Organism-Source-SequenceLength"
Each folder should additionally contain a readme file describing the
data, where it came from, who retrieved it and when it was retrieved.

The files all.fasta and Schizosaccharomyces_pombe.ASM294v2.30.dna.genome.fasta
contain sequences that are not found in any other files and do not have
any documentation.
