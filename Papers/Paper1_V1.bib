    abstract = {The {DUST} module has been used within {BLAST} for many years to mask low-complexity sequences. In this paper, we present a new implementation of the {DUST} module that uses the same function to assign a complexity score to a sequence, but uses a different rule by which high-scoring sequences are masked. The new rule masks every nucleotide masked by the old rule and occasionally masks more. The new masking rule corrects two related deficiencies with the old rule. First, the new rule is symmetric with respect to reversing the sequence. Second, the new rule is not context sensitive; the decision to mask a subsequence does not depend on what sequences flank it. The new implementation is at least four times faster than the old on the human genome. We show that both the percentage of additional bases masked and the effect on {MegaBLAST} outputs are very small.},

    abstract ={Motivation: {DNA} binding proteins play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression. Transcription factors (TFs) activate or repress genes directly while other proteins influence chromatin structure for transcription. Binding sites of a TF exhibit a similar sequence pattern called a motif. However, a one-to-one map does not exist between each TF and motif. Many TFs in a protein family may recognize the same motif with subtle nucleotide differences leading to different binding affinities. Additionally, a particular TF may bind different motifs under certain conditions, for example in the presence of different co-regulators. The availability of genome-wide binding data of multiple collaborative TFs makes it possible to detect such context-dependent motifs.Results: We developed a contrast motif finder (CMF) for the de novo identification of motifs that are differentially enriched in two sets of sequences. Applying this method to a number of TF binding datasets from mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that CMF achieves substantially higher accuracy than several well-known motif finding methods. By contrasting sequences bound by distinct sets of TFs, CMF identified two different motifs that may be recognized by Oct4 dependent on the presence of another co-regulator and detected subtle motif signals that may be associated with potential competitive binding between Sox2 and Tcf3.Availability: The software CMF is freely available for academic use at www.stat.ucla.edu/∼zhou/CMFContact: zhou@stat.ucla.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online and the CMF website.},

    abstract ={Motivation: With the accumulation of genome-wide binding data for many transcription factors (TFs) in the same cell type or cellular condition, it is of great current interest to systematically infer the complex regulatory logic among multiple TFs. In particular, ChIP-Seq data have been generated for 14 core TFs critical to the maintenance and reprogramming of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This provides a great opportunity to study the regulatory collaboration and interaction among these TFs and with other unknown co-regulators.Results: In combination with liquid association among gene expression profiles, we develop a computational method to predict context-dependent (CD) co-egulators of these core TFs in ESCs from pairwise binding datasets. That is, co-occupancy between a core TF and a predicted co-regulator depends on the presence or absence of binding sites of another core TF, which is regarded as a binding context. Unbiased external validation confirms that the predicted CD binding of a co-regulator is reliable. Our results reveal a detailed CD co-regulation network among the 14 core TFs and provide many other potential co-regulators showing strong agreement with the literature.Availability: See www.stat.ucla.edu/~zhou/CMF for software and source code.Contact: zhou@stat.ucla.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

    abstract ={Motivation: Motif discovery is now routinely used in high-throughput studies including large-scale sequencing and proteomics. These datasets present new challenges. The first is speed. Many motif discovery methods do not scale well to large datasets. Another issue is identifying discriminative rather than generative motifs. Such discriminative motifs are important for identifying co-factors and for explaining changes in behavior between different conditions.Results: To address these issues we developed a method for DECOnvolved Discriminative motif discovery ({DECOD}). {DECOD} uses a k-mer count table and so its running time is independent of the size of the input set. By deconvolving the k-mers {DECOD} considers context information without using the sequences directly. {DECOD} outperforms previous methods both in speed and in accuracy when using simulated and real biological benchmark data. We performed new binding experiments for p53 mutants and used {DECOD} to identify p53 co-factors, suggesting new mechanisms for p53 activation.Availability: The source code and binaries for {DECOD} are available at {http://www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/DECOD} Contact: zivbj@cs.cmu.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

    abstract ={One of the greatest challenges that modern molecular biology is facing is the understanding of the complex mechanisms regulating gene expression. A fundamental step in this process requires the characterization of regulatory motifs playing key roles in the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In particular, transcription is modulated by the interaction of transcription factors with their corresponding binding sites. Weeder Web is a web interface to Weeder, an algorithm for the automatic discovery of conserved motifs in a set of related regulatory DNA sequences. The motifs found are in turn likely to be instances of binding sites for some transcription factor. Other than providing access to the program, the interface has been designed so to make usage of the program itself as simple as possible, and to require very little prior knowledge about the length and the conservation of the motifs to be found. In fact, the interface automatically starts different runs of the program, each one with different parameters, and provides the user with an overall summary of the results as well as some ‘advice’ on which motifs look more interesting according to their statistical significance and some simple considerations. The web interface is available at the address www.pesolelab.it by following the ‘Tools’ link.},

abstract ={The spindle checkpoint monitors mitotic spindle integrity and the attachment of kinetochores to the spindle. Upon sensing a defect the checkpoint blocks cell cycle progression and thereby prevents chromosome missegregation. Previous studies in budding yeast show that the activated spindle checkpoint inhibits the onset of anaphase by an unknown mechanism. One possible target of the spindle checkpoint is anaphase promoting complex (APC), which controls all postmetaphase events that are blocked by spindle checkpoint activation. We have isolated mad2, a spindle checkpoint component in fission yeast, and shown that mad2 overexpression activates the checkpoint and causes a cell cycle arrest at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. In addition to the observation that mad2-induced arrest can be partially relieved by mitosis-promoting factor inactivation, we present genetic evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the spindle checkpoint imposes a cell cycle arrest by inhibiting APC-dependent proteolysis.},

Mad2 formed a complex with Slp1, a WD (tryptophan{\textendash}aspartic acid){\textendash}repeat protein essential for the onset of anaphase. When the physical interaction between the two proteins was disrupted, the spindle checkpoint was no longer functional. Post-anaphase events such as chromosome decondensation and the next round of DNA replication were not delayed even when the spindle assembly was incomplete. This relief of dependence appears to be a result of deregulation of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex.},
