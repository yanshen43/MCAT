/*!
 \class Sequence::SeqException Sequence/SeqExceptions.hpp
 All exceptions thrown by routines defined in namespace Sequence are
 derived from a common base class, Sequence::SeqException.
 This class contains a private member, message, which is a C-style
 string.  message is use to store and report error messages when
 exceptions need to be thrown.  The member function SeqException::print
 takes a reference to an ostream as an argument, an can be used to
 display message. The output operator<< can also be used on objects of this type.
 Alternately, if you need to display the message in some
 other fashion, the public member function SeqException::error
 will return message to you as a const char *
