To run the weblogo tool, first the Ghostscript program must be installed

To do this, simply run the following commands:

1. tar -zxf ghostscript-9.19.tar.gz
2. ./configure (in the directory where you unzipped the files)
3. sudo make install (in the directory where you unzipped the files)

The only change needed to be made in the weblogo configuration is to
rename the configuration file from logo.conf.init to logo.conf, if
this is not already done. The file paths present in the conf file
will work with the installation process described above.

Once ghostscript is setup, you can run the weblogo tool (again,
from the directory where it is unzipped; otherwise, simply
change the preceding file path from ./ as appropriate) 
with the following command line:

./seqlogo -F PNG -c -f cap_binding_sites.txt > cap.png

The file referenced above, cap_binding_sites.txt, is provided as an example 
of the input format.
